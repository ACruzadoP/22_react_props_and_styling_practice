This is 23rd screencast, called "23. React Props and Styling Practice"<br />
https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact

// One LAST time in this course, set up a React app from scratch<br />
// Render an App component<br />
  // App should be in its own file<br />
// App should render 5 Joke components<br />
  // Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchLine" prop<br />
  // and render those however you'd like<br /><br />
  
// EXTRA CREDIT:<br />
// Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:<br />
  // E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."<br />
// If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?<br />
// Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component
