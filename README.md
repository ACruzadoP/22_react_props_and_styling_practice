This is 22nd screencast, called "22. React Props and Styling Practice"<br />
https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact

<br />
One LAST time in this course, set up a React app from scratch and render an App component.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App should be in its own file.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App should render 5 Joke components.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchLine" prop and render those however you'd like<br /><br />
  
<br />
EXTRA CREDIT:<br />
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."<br />
If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?<br />
Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component.
